Titanic Survival Insights

This project visualizes Titanic survival patterns of passengers by using Jupyter Notebook(infographic_project.ipynb).
It creates a 2Ã—2 infographic dashboard showing how factors such as gender, age group, embarkation town, and passenger class affected survival rates.
Features
